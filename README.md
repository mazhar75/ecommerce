# 🛒 Ecommerce Platform (In Development)

A fully-featured e-commerce backend currently under active development.  
This project is being built with **Clean Architecture** and **Software Engineering Best Practices** to ensure long-term scalability, maintainability, and testability.

---

## 📌 Project Status
🚧 **Work in Progress** — This repository contains the ongoing implementation of the backend.  
Features, APIs, and modules are being gradually developed and tested.

---

## 🎯 Goals & Best Practices

- **Clean Architecture Layers:** Domain, Use Case, Interface Adapters, Frameworks & Drivers  
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD):** Business logic separated from infrastructure concerns  
- **REST API Standards:** Consistent HTTP methods, status codes, and payload structures  
- **GitHub Workflow:** Commit conventions, PR reviews, and feature branches  
- **CI/CD Ready:** Plan for automated testing and deployment pipelines  
- **PostgreSQL Integration:** Scalable relational database backend  
- **Middleware Plan:** Logging, authentication, and CORS handling

## 🏗️ Clean Architecture Vision

- **Domain Layer** → Business entities and rules (independent of frameworks)  
- **Use Case Layer** → Application-specific logic that uses domain models  
- **Interface Adapters** → Bridges between domain and frameworks (HTTP, DB)  
- **Frameworks & Drivers** → External services like PostgreSQL, HTTP server

## 📅 Development Roadmap

- [ ] Set up basic project structure with Go modules  
- [ ] Implement PostgreSQL connection and repository interfaces  
- [ ] Add product & order domain models  
- [ ] Create HTTP handlers and routing  
- [ ] Implement authentication middleware  
- [ ] Write unit tests and integration tests  
- [ ] Add CI/CD pipelines  
- [ ] Prepare production deployment scripts
